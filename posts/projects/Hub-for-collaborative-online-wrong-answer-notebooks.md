# Core Technique


## ðŸ”‘ Infinite Scroll for problem list
<details>
<summary><i>Click to expand!</i></summary>

## Implementing Infinite Scroll in React

### Introduction

Infinite scrolling is a design pattern in which content is loaded continuously as the user scrolls down the page, eliminating the need for pagination. In this article, we'll walk through the implementation of infinite scrolling in a React component using the `react-intersection-observer` package.

### Infinite Scroll Component

The main component is `InfiniteProblemCards`, which is responsible for displaying problem cards and loading more when the user reaches the end of the list.

```jsx
const InfiniteProblemCards: React.FC<InfiniteProblemCardsProps> = ({ searchParams, currentUser }) => {
    const { problems, hasMore, setPage } = useFetchProblems({searchParams});
    const { ref, inView } = useInView({ threshold: 0 });
    
    useEffect(() => {
        if (inView && hasMore) {
            setPage(oldPage => oldPage + 1);
        }
    }, [inView, hasMore]);

    // Render problem cards here...

    return (
        //...
    );
};
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `useFetchProblems`: A custom hook that fetches problems based on given search parameters.
- `useInView`: A hook from `react-intersection-observer` which gives us the `ref` and `inView` properties. The `ref` is attached to a div at the bottom of our list, and `inView` becomes `true` when this div becomes visible on the screen.
- `useEffect`: This effect checks if the div is in view and there are more problems to fetch. If both conditions are true, it increments the page number to fetch the next set of problems.

## Fetching Data for Infinite Scroll in React

### Introduction

Fetching data efficiently is crucial for a smooth infinite scrolling experience. In this article, we'll discuss the implementation of the `useFetchProblems` hook and the `getProblems` function, which together fetch problems based on search parameters.

### The useFetchProblems Hook

This custom hook manages the state of problems, the current page, and whether there are more problems to fetch.

```jsx
const useFetchProblems = ({ searchParams }: UseFetchProblemsProps) => {
    const [problems, setProblems] = useState<Problem[]>([]);
    const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
    const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchProblems = async (page: number) => {
            // Fetch problems...
        };
      
        fetchProblems(page);
    }, [page, searchParams]);

    return { problems, hasMore, setPage };
};
```

The main responsibilities of this hook are:

- Maintain the `problems`, `page`, and `hasMore` states.
- Define a `fetchProblems` function inside a `useEffect` that fetches problems based on the current page and search parameters.

### The getProblems Function

This function constructs the appropriate API URL using the `query-string` library and fetches problems.

```jsx
const getProblems = async (query: Query = {}): Promise<Problem[]> => {
    const url = qs.stringifyUrl({
        url: URL,
        query: { /* ... */ },
    });

    const res = await fetch(url);
    return res.json();
};
```

The function takes a query object as an argument, which contains filtering parameters such as `websiteId`, `tagId`, etc. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and makes a GET request to fetch problems.

## Conclusion

Infinite scrolling provides a seamless experience for users by continuously loading content as they scroll. By combining the `react-intersection-observer` library with efficient data fetching techniques, we can easily implement this feature in React applications.

## ðŸ”‘ React Hook of action for favorite problem
<details>
<summary><i>Click to expand!</i></summary>

## Article: Implementing a "Favorite" Feature in React

### Introduction

One of the most common features in modern web applications is the ability for users to mark content as their "favorite". This interaction is often represented by a heart or star icon. In this article, we'll explore the implementation of a "favorite" feature for problems using Next.js, React, and Prisma.

### The Hook: `useFavorite`

The core logic for the favorite functionality is encapsulated in a custom React hook called `useFavorite`. This hook manages the state and actions related to favoriting a problem.

#### Key Features of `useFavorite`:

1. **State Management**: The hook maintains the state for whether a problem is favorited (`hasFavorited`) and if an API request is currently being made (`isLoading`).
   
2. **Toggle Logic**: The `toggleFavorite` function handles the logic for either adding or removing a problem from the user's favorites. 
   
3. **User Authentication**: If a user is not authenticated, they are prompted to log in when they attempt to favorite a problem.

```jsx
const useFavorite = ({ problemId, currentUser }: IUseFavorite) => {
  // ... state definitions ...

  const toggleFavorite = useCallback(async (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    e.stopPropagation();

    if (!currentUser) {
      return loginModal.onOpen();
    }
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
        let request;
  
        if (hasFavorited) {
          request = () => axios.delete(`/api/favorites/${problemId}`);
        } else {
          request = () => axios.post(`/api/favorites/${problemId}`);
        }
  
        await request();
        router.refresh();
        toast.success('Like this problem!');
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error('Something went wrong.');
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
  }, 
  [
    currentUser, 
    hasFavorited, 
    problemId, 
    loginModal,
    router
  ]);

  return {
    hasFavorited,
    toggleFavorite,
    isLoading,
  }
}
```

### The Component: `HeartButton`

The `HeartButton` component is a visual representation of the "favorite" feature. Users can click on it to either add or remove a problem from their favorites.

```jsx
const HeartButton: React.FC<HeartButtonProps> = ({ 
    problemId,
    currentUser
}) => {
  const { hasFavorited, toggleFavorite, isLoading } = useFavorite({
    problemId,
    currentUser
  });

  // ... render logic ...

  return (
    <div 
      onClick={toggleFavorite}
      className="..."
    >
      // ... icon display logic ..
      { isLoading ? 
        hasFavorited ? <div className="font-semibold">unsaving...</div> :
        <div className="font-semibold">saving...</div>  :
        (
          <>
            <AiOutlineLike
              size={32}
              className="
                fill-white
                absolute
                -top-[2px]
                -right-[2px]
              "
            />
            <AiFillLike
              size={28}
              className={hasFavorited ? 'fill-rose-500' : 'fill-neutral-500/70'}
            />
          </>
        )
      }
    </div>
   );
}
```

### API Endpoints: `POST` and `DELETE`

The favorite functionality relies on two key API endpoints:

1. **POST**: Adds a problem to the user's favorites.
2. **DELETE**: Removes a problem from the user's favorites.

These endpoints interact with a Prisma model named `FavoriteIds` that stores the relationships between users and their favorited problems.

```ts
model FavoriteIds{
  id           String    @id @default(uuid())
  favoriteId   String
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId       String

  @@index([userId])
}
```

The `POST` endpoint creates a new record in the `FavoriteIds` table linking the user to the problem they favorited. The `DELETE` endpoint removes this record, effectively "unfavoriting" the problem for the user.

### Conclusion

Implementing a "favorite" feature in a web application enhances user engagement and provides a more personalized experience. By using Next.js for server-side logic, React for the frontend, and Prisma for database interactions, developers can create an efficient and user-friendly favorite feature. Whether it's articles, images, or problems, the strategy remains consistent: manage state, provide visual feedback, and handle data operations efficiently.
